Original Game: https://www.roblox.com/games/2262441883/Electric-State-DarkRP-Beta

This is a simple autofarm for electric state. The game gives you template data before your actual player data loads. 
This template data has 1k cash, an online friend of mine had told me about it and had asked me if I could do anything with that 1k.
I found out that by purchasing a prop, placing it, waiting until the data loads, selling it and then rejoining (repeat), would allow the player to earn rought 1k every 8-10 seconds.
